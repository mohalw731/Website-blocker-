# Website-blocker-
Website blocker in Python 

The Python Website Blocker application is a mini-project that allows users to block websites on their system by adding them to the host file. This project is created using Python's Tkinter module, which is used to create a simple GUI that allows users to input URLs they wish to block or unblock.

The application consists of two main functions, Block() and Unblock(), which are used to block and unblock websites, respectively. The Block() function takes a URL as input and adds it to the host file to block access to that website. The Unblock() function takes a URL as input and removes it from the host file to unblock access to that website.

To use the Tkinter module in this project, users must have a basic understanding of Python, including defining functions and creating loops. The project requires installing the Tkinter module using the "pip install tk" command.

The project's file structure includes importing required libraries, creating the GUI window, defining the host path and IP address, creating the Block() and Unblock() functions, creating labels and buttons, and the main command to execute the project.

Creating this Python Website Blocker application would be a great addition to your portfolio as it showcases your skills in Python programming and GUI development. It also demonstrates your ability to create practical applications that can solve real-world problems, such as blocking access to distracting websites during work hours.
